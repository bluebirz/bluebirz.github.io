Many times I have to find several words among tens or hundreds, or maybe thousands of files in one folder. I'm not sure if the words is in subfolders or not.

So I need a helper and it's **"Ripgrep"**.

---

## Ripgrep

Ripgrep is a command line tool with high capacity to work on file searching operations. There are claims[^1] that Ripgrep is faster than many grep tools.

Below is the github repo of the producer.

{% include bbz_custom/link_preview.html url='<https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep>' %}

As far as I used it, I am satisfied with its speed and result display. It provides result with concise and readable colorful highlighted way.

By default, Ripgrep is searching for the regular expression we supplied. But we can add flags like exact matches, files only, and even hidden files (such as files listed in ".gitignore").

### Basic use

Assume that we have installed Ripgrep into our computer or projects, we can start searching something like this.

```sh
rg "<regex>"     # current path
rg "<regex>" .   # current path as . (dot)
```

![rg basic](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ripgrep/01-rg-basic.png){:style="max-width:90%;margin:auto;"}

This simple command uses Ripgrep to search that text as a regular expression in all files in the current directory and subdirectories.

### Find text in hidden directory

We can use the flag `--hidden` or `-.` to search in the hidden files or folders, like this.

```sh
rg --hidden "<regex>" .
rg -. "<regex>" .
```

![rg hidden](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ripgrep/02-rg-hidden.png){:style="max-width:90%;margin:auto;"}

### List only files

Then we can use the flag `-l` to list only the file name that contain the text.

```sh
rg -l "<regex>" . # only files
rg -l. "<regex>" . # only files including hidden files
```

![rg only files](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ripgrep/03-rg-fileonly.png){:style="max-width:90%;margin:auto;"}

### Exact match

If we want to search for the exact match of the text, we can use the flag `--word-regexp` or `-w`.

```sh
rg --word-regexp "<exact_text>" .
rg -w "<exact_text>" .
```

![rg exact match](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ripgrep/04-rg-exact.png){:style="max-width:90%;margin:auto;"}

As above, `"Boston"` is a word that exists in those files but `"oston"` can't be found because it's not a word, it's just a substring.

## Ripgrep all

`rga` or "ripgrep all" is the command that searches broader than `rg` in terms of file types such as `.pdf`, `.docx`, etc. while `rg` can search in text-based such as `.md`, `.js`, `.py`, etc.

{% include bbz_custom/link_preview.html url='<https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all?tab=readme-ov-file>' %}

`rga` adopts command line options from `rg` and adds some more options to search in more file types.

### search in DOCXs

Say we have Microsoft Word files. If we use normal `rg`, the result is nothing. But with `rga`, we can get results.

```sh
rga "<regex>" .
```

![rga docx](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ripgrep/05-rga-docx.png){:style="max-width:90%;margin:auto;"}

### search in PDFs

Like `rga` on DOCX files, we also use `rga` on PDF files. Additionally, it displays page numbers too.

```sh
rga "<regex>" .
```

![rga pdf](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ripgrep/06-rga-pdf.png){:style="max-width:90%;margin:auto;"}

### search a set of word (order accordingly)

We know that the regex `"regex_1 | regex_2` means that we are looking for `regex_1` or `regex_2`. And `"regex_1.*regex_2` means that we are looking for `regex_1` and `regex_2` in the same line in the accordingly order.

But how can we search for `regex_1` and `regex_2` in the same file but not in the same line?

We add the flag `--multiline` to tell it to search across multiple lines. Sometimes we need to adjust the regex by having `(?s)` or add the flag `--multiline-dotall` in order to cover new-line characters.[^2]

```sh
rga --multiline "<regex_1>.*<regex_2>" .
rga -U "<regex_1>.*<regex_2>" . # same as --multiline

rga --multiline "(?s)<regex_1>.*<regex_2>" . # handle new-line characters
rga -U "(?s)<regex_1>.*<regex_2>" . # same as --multiline, handle new-line characters

rga --multiline --multiline-dotall "<regex_1>.*<regex_2>" # handle new-line characters.
rga -U --multiline-dotall "<regex_1>.*<regex_2>" # same as --multiline, handle new-line characters
```

![rga multiline](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ripgrep/07-rga-pdf-multiline.png){:style="max-width:90%;margin:auto;"}

### search a set of word (regardless of order)

Then how should we do search several words without respecting orders?

We need a trick to do so.

```sh
rga "<regex_2>" $(rga "<regex_1>" -l .)
```

This implies that we search for files containing `regex_1` first and then search for `regex_2` in those files.

The output will be just the text `regex_2` only so that we need to ensure that `regex_1` is correct.
