Hello all!

This article is about Bash language I have worked with a lot in my company. I would say my tasks mostly involve CLI (Command Line Interface) intensively and this is a chance to show off my often-used commands of Bash.

Let's go!

## What is Bash

Bash is a one of shell scripts available on UNIX OS. Some of the others are cmd and powershell which are working on Windows OS. We don't have to install any programs before running Bash because it has been pre-installed inside.

---

## Section: Path

In Unix, `~` indicates root path while `.` is current directory and `..` is parent directory.

In case of current path value, we use `pwd`. `ls` is for listing files and folders in the current path. And `cd` is to change directories.

- `~`  
  root path
- `.`
  current directory
- `..`  
  parent directory
- `pwd`: print working directory's name  
  current path value
- `ls`: list  
  list of files and folder in current path
- `cd`: change directory  
  change directory

![bash path](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-bash/ls.png)

As the example above, `ls` show files and folders in the current path. Additionally, `ls -la` (list – **l**ong format & **a**ll) shows details that is permissions, owner name, last modified date etc. of each file/folder.

`pwd` displays current path value and we can change the current directory using `cd` with the target directory. `cd ~` means change to root directory ( `/root` ).

---

## Section: Files/folders management

Making a new directory with `mkdir` or a new empty file with `touch`. Want to delete a file? use `rm` or `rm -r` if that is a folder.

`cp` is for copying a file/folder or move/rename it with `mv`.

- `rm`: remove  
  remove a file, for a folder add `-r`.
- `mkdir`: make directory  
  making a new folder
- `mv`: move  
  move or rename a file/folder
- `cp`: copy  
  copy a file/folder
- `touch`  
  create an empty file

![bash file management](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-bash/pwd.png)

I created a new folder using `mkdir test01`. And access it with `cd test01` then create an empty file by `touch test01_a.txt`. After that, copy it to a new file via `cp test01_a.txt test01_b.txt`.

Inside the folder "test01", I created a new folder named "test02" then move "test01_b.txt" using `mv test01_b.txt test02/`. The path of "test01_b.txt" has been changed to "test02/test01_b.txt".

For renaming, we have to specify the name of the file after moving such as `mv test01_b.txt test02/test02_b.txt`.

---

## Section: Permissions

We need to change permissions of the file and we can apply them by `chmod` while `chown` is for changing owners.

For some files which require advance permissions, `sudo` will execute it. And `su` is for changing users in the system.

- `chmod`: **ch**ange **mod**e  
  change permissions of a file/folder
- `chown`: **ch**ange **own**ership  
  change owner of a file/folder
- `sudo`: **su**peruser **do**  
  Execute some commands with advance permissions
- `su`: **s**witch **u**ser  
  change user

![bash permissions](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-bash/chmod.png)

As a figure above, `ls -la` of the file "test01_a.txt" shows its permissions as the followings:

![permissions matrix](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-bash/chmod-EN.drawio.png)

```sh
ls -la
-rw-r--r –  1 root  root    0 Nov 10 14:27 test01_a.txt
# (-)rw-r--r – ==> text01_a.txt is a file
# -(rw-)r--r – ==> OWNER name "root" can read or write the file but cannot execute it
# -rw-(r--)r – ==> GROUP name "root" can read it but cannot write or execute it
# -rw-r--(r--) ==> OTHERS can read it but cannot write or execute it
```

`chmod +x` will add permissions to execute the file to everyone (OWNER, GROUP, OTHERS). That command will change the permissions to `-rwxr-xr-x`. And I use `chown -R` (Recursive to subfolders) to change OWNER from root to tester for itself and its subfolders.

Finally, switch user to tester with `su tester`.

## Section: Operators

- `|` (pipe)  
  It is for serial execution. Left command has to be finished execution then the right one will be executed. Result will be from the right one.
- `&` (ampersand)  
  It is for parallel execution. The commands in each side of this operator will be executed simultaneously. Result will be from both without ordering.
- `||` (logical OR)  
  Respective execution. The program will be successfully executed if ANY commands are successfully executed. Result is from the very first succeeded command.
- `&&` (logical AND)  
  Respective execution. The program will be successfully executed if ALL commands are successfully executed. Result is from all succeeded commands.

![bash operator](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-bash/operator.png)

First. `echo "a" | echo "b"`, the left command is finished then the right one is finished. Result is from the right that is "b".

Second. `echo "a" & echo "b"`, both are executed simultaneously and the right one is finished before the first one. Result is "b" then "a".

Third. `echo "a" || echo "b"`, the left command is executed successfully and the result is "a". The right one cannot be executed. The program succeeded.

Last one. `echo "a" && echo "b"`, the left command is executed successfully then the right one is so. The result is "a" then "b". The program succeeded.

## Section: String

We command `echo` to display a string or a value and `cat` to read a file.

There are so many commands for string decoration. I raise the sample of frequently used commands below:

- `echo`  
  display a string or a value
- `cat`: con**cat**enate  
  read content from a file
- `sed`: **s**tream **ed**itor  
  replace a string inside another string
- `grep`: **g**lobal search – **r**egular **e**xpression – **p**rint  
  Find and display a string inside a string with regular expression
- `cut`  
  do substring

```sh
echo "start"
cat sample_back.sh
echo "a dog wags its tail" | sed -e "s/dog/cat/g"
echo "a fish swims in a jar" | cut -c 1-5
echo "my telephone number is 1234" | grep -o "[0-9]*"
```

![bash string](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-bash/sed.png)

I have created a file named sample_back.sh containing the text "this is a sample file for reading".

And the another file named sample_front.sh containing these commands:

- `echo "start"`. It will show "start"
- `cat sample_back.sh`. It reads the file sample_back.sh and got the same sentence that is "this is a sample file for reading".
- Next, `sed -e "s/dog/cat/g"` is to change the word "dog" to "cat" and got the final sentence as "a cat wags its tail".
- `cut -c 1-5` is to cut all letters (including spaces and other special characters) between position 1-5 of the original sentence. The result is "a fis".
- Last one, `grep -o "[0-9]*"` is to extract only number from "my telephone number is 1234" and got "1234". ( `[0-9]*` is a regular expression for capturing numbers from 0 to 9 plus `*` which means any occurrence of the numbers).

## Section: Conditional structures

### IF-ELSE

```sh
if [[ $a == 1 ]]; then 
    echo "a is 1" 
elif [[ $a == 2 ]]; then 
    echo "a is 2" 
else 
    echo "a is not 1 nor 2"
fi
```

![bash if-else](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-bash/if.png)

It is `if`–`then`–`elif`–`then`–`else` and `fi` at the end.

### FOR-loop

```sh
for i in $list; do
    echo this is $i
done
```

![bash for-loop](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-bash/for.png)

Mostly used when we have to do something to each item in a list.

### WHILE-loop

```sh
while [[ $a -le 10 ]]; do # check if a less than or equals 10
    echo "$a";
    a=$((a+1)); # a = a + 1
done
```

![bash while-loop](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-bash/while.png)

Don't make it an infinite loop.

### TRY-CATCH

Literally Bash has no try-catch block but we can apply it like this.

```sh
{
    # try
} || {
    # catch
}
```

Code above is to run try-block, and in case of failure do run catch-block. They are linked with `||`.

```sh
{
    # try
} && {
    # then
}
```

And the code above is to run try-block, and in case of success do run then-block. They are linked with `&&`.

![bash try-catch](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-bash/try-catch.png)

- First file – test02_v1.sh  
  I added `exit 1` to cause an error and defined "**if failed**, do display this is part 2". We got the message of part 2 as the first block run failed.
- Second file – test02_v2.sh  
  I changed the condition to "**if succeeded**, do display this is part 2". We got nothing as the first block run failed.
- Third file – test02_v3.sh  
  I removed `exit 1` and keep the condition "**if succeeded**, do display this is part 2". We got both part 1 and part 2 as the first block run successfully.

These are basic error handling. They are essential for jobs to manipulate the flows.

> please mind the spaces between brackets and the operators.
{: .prompt-warning }

## Section: Date and time

My mostly-used command is just one that is date but there are many applications.

```sh
$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
$(date -d "-[n] day" +"%Y-%m-%d")
$(date -d "[n] day ago" +"%Y-%m-%)
$(date -d "$(date -d @[epoch_in_seconds])" +"%Y-%m-%d" )
$(date -d "$[target_date] [n] day" +"%Y-%m-%d")
if [[ $(date -d "$date_one" +%s) -le $(date -d "$date_two" +%s) ]]; then
    echo "$date_one is LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO $date_two"
else
    echo "$date_one is GREATER THAN $date_two"
fi
```

![bash date](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-bash/date.png)

`-d` will translate a string to a date object. As the example above, `-1 day` is as same as `1 day ago` that is yesterday so `2019-01-01 1 day` means "1 day after 2019-01-01" that is 2019-01-02.

`@[epoch_in_second]` is UNIX epoch which is an integer form of date object such as `@1546300800` equals to "2019-01-01 00:00:00 AM" (more information at <https://www.epochconverter.com>)

`+"..."` defines output format. For example, `+"%Y-%m-%d"` means "year-month-date" e.g. 2019-01-10 and `+"%s"` means epoch format as mention before. The last format can be used to compare two dates as the last set of commands above.

## Section: Externally execution

- `source`  
  Refer other Bash files
- `sh`
  Externally execute a Bash file

![bash exec](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-bash/source.png)

First file – "test01.sh" contains "test_var". After `source test01.sh` we can display the value of "test_var" from outside.

Second file – "test02.sh" contains `echo command`. After `sh test02.sh`, it triggers `echo` and display the text.

---

## Section: Functions

Function structure is described below:

```sh
sample_func() {
  local a=$1 # local variable
  local b=$2 # local variable
  echo "first is $a and second is $b"
}

sample_func 1 2
```

![bash func](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-bash/func.png)

We have to define functions before use them. And how to call them is to type their names following parameters separated by space.

As the example, we call `sample_func` with parameters as 1 and 2. Inside the function, value "1" will be `$1` and be assigned to variable a while value "2" will be `$2` then be assigned to variable b. It displays "first is 1 and second is 2" at the end.

---

## Section: Comments

There are 2 ways to add a comment

- insert `#` in front of a line
- begin a multiline comment with `: << [word]` and end with `[word]`

```sh
# this is a single-line comment
: << 'comment'
    this 
    is 
    the 
    multi-lines
    of 
    comments
comment
```

![bash comment](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-bash/comment.png)

As the example, "b" won't be shown as it is a comment. And "d", "e", and "f" are neither as they are in multi-line comment controlled by the word "a_comment".

---

As I said, they are most often used of mine in the jobs. There are also different commands not mentioned here. And I hope this is useful for some of you readers.

Let's see what's next.

Bye~
