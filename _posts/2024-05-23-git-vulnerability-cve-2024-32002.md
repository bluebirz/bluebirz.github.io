## Solution

Simple now as there are patches and we need to update our git.

### check version

The patch versions are since v2.39.4.

We can check our current git version by run the command

```sh
git -v
```

Mine was "git version 2.39.3 (Apple Git-146)" and it needed to be updated.

### Update git in MacOS

We can use homebrew to update it.

```sh
# install git
brew install git

# symlink git 
brew unlink git && brew link git
```
