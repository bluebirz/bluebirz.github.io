I have an opportunity to attend a seminar about the Johari window model. It is a model to reflect us about our relationship with others. The model is so simple yet powerful enough to improve the relationship and our own self. This model has the name "Johari" from the founder "Joseph Luft" and "Harry Ingham" who created it in 1955.

## What is "Johari window model"?

This "Johari window model" partitions one's expressions towards others' perceptions through a 2x2 matrix. The matrix looks like this figure.

*Johari window model*

1. **open** is the open part of our own.  
  For example, They know I'm kind as I always help them. A kindness is a part I control and let them see.
1. **blind** is a part the others can see but we don't notice it.  
  For example, They think I'm hot-tempered and bossy because I usually urge and shout at them for the works but I think everyone is just lazy and I just want to get the works done.
1. **hide** is a hidden part of ourselves.  
  For example, I am so exhausted at work because of my personal problems but I have to say it's all okay not to let them worry about me.
1. **unknown** is the part in our shadows that no one knows before.  
  For example, I never know I am a good presenter because there are very few activities in my company and one of my colleague all the time is the MC of those activities.

## How can one improve them?

Look at the diagram below.

*Johari window model with improvement*

We can improve our relationship with others by:

1. **open**  is good now.  
  We are doing good right here because we are open to them.
1. **blind**  area can be reduced by **feedback**
  We need to have feedback from others as these blind parts need reflections.
1. **hide** area can be reduced by **disclose**  
  We can show them some hidden parts as long as we trust and feed secure to them. However the hidden area is also our own privacy that we don't need to expose the whole of them if we are feeling uncomfortable.
1. **unknown** area can be reduced by:  
    - **discover together**  
      Ice-breaking and some group activities can help us explore and discover potentials for strengthening our healthy mind and relationship.
    - **notice by others**  
      Sometimes, we would have an accidental comment from others who just notice something about us. This would be a good thing that we see a room for improvement that might not be found from daily life.
    - **self-explore**  
      We may overlook but we can explore ourselves by relaxing and slowly pondering about it. Give it time so things would be better.

We human are social animals. Therefore we can rely on others to thrive and enjoy our days together.
