Hi! Hi! All guys~

Previously I talked about [Docker]({% post_url 2019-09-19-try-docker %}) for afford us programmers the ready-to-eat environments. This time it's the turn of source code as we have to write them for tens or hundreds files. Let's see what can be happened:

- Misunderstanding about requirements and just realize the source code has been writing so far.
- Handling conflicts from multiple programmers in one projects.
- Find out the easiest way to deploy on production servers
- Share our source code as an open-source
- and hundreds reasons

Therefore, we shall go meet Git!

---

## This is Git

Git is a repository for our precious source code. It also affords the maintenance.

This repository is similar to an online shared drive. We can put, update, replace, restore, share, and merge source code with colleagues or even strangers (if we want!)

Its environment can be explained like this:

![git flow](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-git/git_v01.png)

- **working directory**  
  A place of our source code in physical drives
- **staging**  
  It is a repository (I will call "repo" for short) for verification before submitting to the Git server.
- **local repo**  
  When we verify ones on staging, we can confirm them to be moved to local repo. This is happened before moving to a real Git server on cloud.
- **remote repo**  
  The destination of our source code

---

## Begin with Git

### 1. Git server

We can find free Git server such as

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p><i class="fa-brands fa-github" style="font-size: 2.5em;"></i></p></td>
    <td><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a></strong> A famous Git server. I guess you once heard its name. It's spotlight is a large open-source community.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><i class="fa-brands fa-gitlab" style="font-size: 2.5em;"></i></p></td>
    <td><p><strong><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" target="_blank">Gitlab</a></strong> Also famous. Gitlab has CI/CD as an out-of-the-box feature so we can do an automation on this. Nah, I have no chance to play around with it.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><i class="fa-brands fa-bitbucket" style="font-size: 2.5em;"></i></p></td>
    <td><p><strong><a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">BitBucket</a></strong> I have been using it on my workplace. BitBucket is under Atlassian and completely integrated with the sibling products e.g. Jira or Confluence.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

And we have a choice to make our own Git server.

### 2. Git account

In case we chose one of above 3 choices, we need to register an account.

### 3. Install Git client

- **Windows**  
  download from <https://git-scm.com/download/win>
- **Unix**  
  with command yum install git-core or apt install git-core (depends on distro)
- **OSX**  
  Innate installed with OSX Maverick

For any installation problems, please check this out <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>

### 4. Make a repo

Repo is like a folder of all source code. For example, I created a repo named "test_git".

![make repo](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-git/Screen-Shot-2562-10-01-at-20.46.48.png)

### 5. Register our machine's public key to the Git server

Next we need to allow Git server to access files in our machine. Public key is a key to verify it and we are going to register our public key on Git server setting.

#### 5.1 Generate a public key

We can follow this link to generate it: <https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/set-up-an-ssh-key-728138079.html>

![ssh-keygen](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-git/Screen-Shot-2562-10-01-at-22.10.00.png)

#### 5.2 Add our public key

Add our public key (in `.pub` file) to SSH key setting page of our Git account.

![add pubkey](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-git/Screen-Shot-2562-10-01-at-22.16.28.png)

### 6. Start syncing

Use `git init` and `.git` folder will be created. This folder is like records to manage all files between our machine and Git server.

```sh
git init
```

![git init](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-git/Screen-Shot-2562-10-01-at-22.19.14.png)

> Only files placed inside a folder having `.git` can be detected and moved to Git server.
{: .prompt-warning}

Add a destination repo to `.git` file with this command.

```sh
git remote add origin [git_url]
```

We can find `git_url` in the pattern `git@github.com:abc/repo.git` as the example figure below (My github repo)

![clone ssh](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-git/Screen-Shot-2562-10-01-at-22.37.55.png)

Once we finished command `git remote add origin`, our machine is ready.

We command `git remote show origin` to ensure everything is ok.

![git remote add](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-git/Screen-Shot-2562-10-01-at-22.39.21.png)

### 7. Set user's properties

```sh
git config – global user.email "my@email.com"
git config – global user.name "my name"
```

It takes effects when we upload or commit files into Git and check the history.

### 8. Initializing files

We use this to download files from Git to the machine.

```sh
git clone [git_url] [local_path]
```

![git clone](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-git/Screen-Shot-2562-10-02-at-23.09.17.png)

It will copy everything from `git_url` into `local_path` which is automatically working repo.

### 9. Move to staging

After initialization, we are ready to copy our files from machine to the remote repo.

First, enter the working repo.

![cd](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-git/Screen-Shot-2562-10-02-at-23.07.27.png)

Check the status by typing:

```sh
git statush
```

Below means we have no file to add.

![git status](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-git/Screen-Shot-2562-10-02-at-23.00.05.png)

This below show a fresh empty file named `test.txt`.

![touch file](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-git/Screen-Shot-2562-10-02-at-23.01.41.png)

Next, we move this file to staging:

```sh
git add [path_folders_or_files]
```

![git add](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-git/Screen-Shot-2562-10-02-at-23.02.14.png)

See, we got new file: `test.txt`

In case we don't want any file on staging, remove them with:

```sh
git rm -- cached [path_folders_or_files]
```

![git rm](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-git/Screen-Shot-2562-10-02-at-23.02.57.png)

It already moved to untracked files.

But if we want to remove it from both staging and the machine we use this command.

```sh
git rm -f [path_folders_or_files]
```

### 10. Move to local repo

Let me add `test.txt` again and that's all for staging. We will go to local repo with this command.

```sh
git commit -m "description"
```

At "description", we can put any text to describe what we do at this time. This helps us recall in the future.

![git commit](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-git/Screen-Shot-2562-10-02-at-23.04.21.png)

### 11. Move to remote repo

At the time we commit, the change is in form of a branch. If we confirm to make this change over the remote repo, type this.

```sh
git push origin master
```

Now the current branch (origin by default) are merging with the main folder (master).

![git push](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-git/Screen-Shot-2562-10-02-at-23.05.06.png)

### 12. Check it out on Git server

![check at github page](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/try-git/Screen-Shot-2562-10-02-at-23.11.10.png)

That's right! `test.txt` that we just commit is showing with the description.

## Last but not least

All above are just a beginning. Those are a very simple ability Git can do. We can do more by using full document at <https://git-scm.com/docs>.

What is next, stay tuned.

Bye~
