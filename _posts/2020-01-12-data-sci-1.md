Hi~ Hi~ all guys.

Happy new year 2020 belatedly. Here is the first time for me after missing blogging so long.

Right now, it's a series about my learning session of Data Science.

Let's begin –

## What is data science for?

Imagine that, we are in a restaurant. I, as a **data engineer**, is like a storage keeper who taking care of fresh and quality ingredients. When a cook want something for a dish, data engineers have to validate and afford them.

So who are cooks? Of course, **data scientists** are. They are mastered how to make a dish more delicious, more nutrients, and more appetizing.

Collaboration of data engineers and data scientists benefits our customers and allow them to gain insights from our data products.

## Tools for data scientists

### Python

Python is one of popular data manipulating languages. We can find ALL of needed libraries of the works. One thing is to make sure we are using Python 3 because Python 2 will be the end of support at the writing time.

Besides, we can write R Language as well.

### Free datasets

There are lots of public dataset and it's free to play around. One of mine is [Kaggle.com/datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and Github.

For Git, it was my old blog about it [here]({% post_url 2019-10-04-try-git %}).

### IDE and Text Editor

Many IDEs (integrated development environment) and Text editors are for Python users as a list here. Pick what you favor.

- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- etc.

For me, I would prefer Jupyter.

### Command line

It's optional if we are using Git on Terminal. [Here]({% post_url 2019-11-18-bash %}) is my old blog about Command line.

Next time will be preliminary data exploration.

See ya~
