## Threat modeling

Threat modeling is a digram to assess and communicate our security structures. We can use <https://app.diagrams.net> to create a simple diagram.

- Use shapes in section "threat modeling"

- Example diagram from lecturer  

    ![diagram](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/lecture-digital-threats/Threat+modeling.jpg)

  - A-box is Asset
  - C-box is Controls, methods to protect the assets and mitigate the risk
  - TA-box is Threat Actor

Below is the link I googled about threat modeling process from OWASP.
