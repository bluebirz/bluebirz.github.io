Got a new small app for Mac. It can display cute icons and monitor the resource of the Mac. It is...

## Runcat

Runcat is a tiny app. Its icon can display how hard your mac is working. Link download is here <https://apps.apple.com/th/app/runcat/id1429033973>.

## Functions

After installing and open Runcat, the icon will be there at taskbar showing animated depends on CPU utilization.

We can click the icon to open menu and select "System Info" to view resource utilization like this.

That's all for its functions. Indeed. But it's cute so I pleased to keep this app running.

## Characters

Yeah, we can change the animated icon to others. See this.

Try some here.

If free icons don't satisfy you, the IAP (In-App Purchase) might be a solution.
