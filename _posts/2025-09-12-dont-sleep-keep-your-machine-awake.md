There are cases we need to have the machine stays active for example, compiling some app, running some tests, leaving some programs working, or just staying online in a game while we actually are AFK (Away From Keyboard.)

These apps can help us and I use it (almost) every day.

## Mac: Amphetamine

> Amphetamine is extremely powerful and includes advanced features for those who need them, yet remains intuitive and simple to use for those who don't need all the bells and whistles.

**Amphetamine** can be installed via App store [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12). After install, we can update settings right here:

![amphetamine settings](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/app-awake/amph1-settings.png){: style="max-width:100%;margin:auto;"}

There are many ways to start new session. It can be a specific period, or until a specific time, or even indefinitely.

![amphetamine menu](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/app-awake/amph2-menu.png){: style="max-width:50%;margin:auto;"}

Once the session is started, we can view the details like when the session will end or we can extend it here as well.

## Windows: Awake

**Awake** is a part of **PowerToys** that is the app collection for Windows for productivity. We can install PowerToys from [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/install).

After install, we can see Awake in the PowerToys settings. Enable it and we should find it in the system tray.

Awake allows us to keep awake indefinitely or for a certain period of time up to 2 hours.

![awake options](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/app-awake/awake2-options.png){: style="max-width:90%;margin:auto;" .apply-border}

And we can move the cursor over the icon in system tray to see how much time it will end.
