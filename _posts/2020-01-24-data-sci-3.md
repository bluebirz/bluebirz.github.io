Hi! all guys

Continued from EP 2, we gonna find out the advance visualizations. We now have some basic stuff of `matplotlib`, so we will create its graphs in more complex way.

I would say the advance here is how the graph can deliver insight in seconds. For some reasons, we might need to know which graph is proper to the purposes.

---

## Multiple trends

**Line graph** would be a good choice to display trends over time or changes. We can separate each trend or called **"breakdown"**. Look here.

We are using data of titanic. Now we pick the column "sex", "age", and "fare" where "age" has values only.

```py
selector = titanic[titanic.Age.isna() == False][[titanic.Sex.name, titanic.Age.name, titanic.Fare.name]]
selector
```

![dataframe with conditions](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/note-data-science-eps/ep-03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-09-at-20.52.37.png)

We already have `DataFrameGroupBy` object with the average value of "fare". After transforming this to `DataFrame`, we remove the index with `.reset_index()` to allow to refer the column name instead of `.index`.

```py
grouper = pd.DataFrame(selector.groupby([titanic.Sex.name, titanic.Age.name]).Fare.mean()).reset_index()
grouper
```

![plt line df](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/note-data-science-eps/ep-03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-09-at-20.52.50.png)

Now we are using `plt.subplots()` as assembled graphs. This function return `fig` which is the background of graph and `ax` which is the foreground.

```py
(fig, ax) = plt.subplots()
```

The first `ax` is planned for female data with x-axis is "age" and y-axis is "fare". It's red.

The second one is male data with blue.

```py
ax.plot(grouper[grouper.Sex == 'female'].Age, grouper[grouper.Sex == 'female'].Fare, c='red', label='female')
ax.plot(grouper[grouper.Sex == 'male'].Age, grouper[grouper.Sex == 'male'].Fare, c='blue', label='male')
```

Using `.legend()` displays a box with labels

```py
plt.legend()
```

Names x-axis and y-axis with `.xlabel()` and `.ylabel()` respectively.

```py
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Fare')
```

![plt line](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/note-data-science-eps/ep-03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-10-at-22.11.19.png)

Just find out that there is no women older than around 60 years there.

## Spectrums graphs

**Scatter graph** is graph with dots representing two dimension of data at the basic. This's the time we include a third dimension.

```py
selector = titanic[titanic.Age.isna() == False][[titanic.Pclass.name, titanic.Age.name, titanic.Fare.name]]
selector
```

We select "Pclass", "Age", and "Fare" from titanic data where "age" has values.

![plt scatter df](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/note-data-science-eps/ep-03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-10-at-22.07.06.png)

```py
selector.plot.scatter(x = selector.Age.name, y = selector.Fare.name, c = selector.Pclass, cmap = plt.cm.rainbow)
```

Run `.plot.scatter()` and assign the columns as x-axis and y-axis. And we add more two parameters there.

- `c`  
  column name to color each breakdown
- `cmap`  
  define color scale using class of `matplotlib.cm`

![plt scatter](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/note-data-science-eps/ep-03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-10-at-22.07.17.png)

As we assign "Pclass" value as c which has 3 different values, the graph show 3 different dot colors.

---

## Stacking piles

Guess you already know stacked bar graph. It is quite good for visualizing data in accumulative with breakdowns. We are going to do that.

```py
selector = titanic[[titanic.Pclass.name, titanic.Sex.name]]
selector
```

Starting with selecting column "Pclass" and "Sex".

![plt stackedi df](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/note-data-science-eps/ep-03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-10-at-23.32.46.png)

We want to view the number of each "Pclass" and "Sex", so `.groupby()` will be used here.

```py
grouper = pd.DataFrame(selector.groupby([selector.Pclass.name, selector.Sex.name]).Sex.count()) \
  :
```

Right now we got `DataFrame` transformed from `DataFrameGroupBy` and its column is only "Sex" from `.count()` while its indices are "Pclass" and "Sex".

```py
:
    .add_suffix("_count") \
    .reset_index() \
    .set_index(selector.Pclass.name)
```

We need "Pclass" as x-axis but we can't apply `.reset_index()` plus `.set_index("Pclass")` at this time, because we gonna got the error as duplicated column name ("Sex").

`.add_suffix()` is the solution to add a text after each columns. We add the word "_count" and get "Sex_count". No duplicated columns now then we do `.reset_index()`.

More about `.add_suffix()` is [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.add_suffix.html).

After this process, we got the result.

![plt stacked df indexed](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/note-data-science-eps/ep-03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-10-at-23.33.33.png)

It's time for graph.

```py
(fig, ax) = plt.subplots()
bar_width = 0.5
_class = grouper[grouper.Sex == 'male'].index
_male_count = grouper[grouper.Sex == 'male'].Sex_count
_female_count = grouper[grouper.Sex == 'female'].Sex_count
```

We use `.subplots()` and declare more 4 variables:

- `bar_width`  
  Width of each bar
- `_class`  
  It is Index that is "Pclass"
- `_male_count`  
  It is Sex_count of male
- `_female_count`  
  It is Sex_count of female

```py
# add male
ax.bar(_class, _male_count, bar_width, label = 'male')
```

Put male data first by `ax.bar()` with 4 parameters:

1. x-axis value is "_class"
1. y-axis value is "_male_count"
1. width of bar is "bar_width"
1. optional parameters: label as "male"

```py
# add female
ax.bar(_class, _female_count, bar_width, bottom = list(_male_count), label = 'female')
```

After male is female, we have to put female boxes on top of male boxes. Here are the parameters:

1. x-axis is "_class"
1. y-axis is "_female_count"
1. width of bar
1. optional parameter: bottom which indicates how high the boxes are floating over. .
  It requires a constant or an array. We want their floati ng height equals to "_male_count" but it currently is `Series` so we use `list()` to cast it for the case.
1. optional parameter: label as "female"

and `.set_xticks()` is for setting x-axis values as "_class".

```py
ax.set_xticks(_class)
```

`.legend()` is for label box.

```py
ax.legend()
```

This code is to put values of each box of the bar.

```py
for p in ax.patches:
    x, y = p.get_xy()
    h = p.get_height()
    ax.annotate(str(h), ((x + p.get_width()/2), (h+y)), ha='center', va='top', color='white')
```

`.patches` returns a list of graph components. At this case, they are rectangles in the graph. We are looking into each of them and put the value with `.annotate()` following by these parameters:

- First is `str(h)` for transform value of "h" to text.  
  "h" equals to `p.get_height()` that is the height of the component. It is "_male_count" or "_female_count" in this case.
- Second is the coordinate of the text consisting of.
- x is `x + p.get_width()/2`.  
  It means value on x-axis at the bottom-left corner added with width of the component. We will get value on x-axis at the middle of the component.
- y is `h + y`.  
  It means height added with value on y-axis at the bottom-left of the component. We will get value on y-axis at the top of the component.
- `ha` stands for horizontal alignment.  
  We use "center" to align the text at the center of the component.
- `va` stands for vertical alignment.  
  We use "top" to align the text at the top of the component.

```py
plt.xlabel('Ticket class')
plt.ylabel('crew count')
```

Use `.xlabel()` and `.ylabel()` to put the label of x-axis and y-axis respectively.

## Seaborn

`seaborn` is another popular Python library to create beautiful graph. We usually import this as a name "sns" which is related to a fictional charactor's name "Samuel Norman Seaborn".

![import seaborn](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/note-data-science-eps/ep-03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-11-at-22.38.45.png)

Let's try some cool graphs from this.

### Joint plot

`sns.jointplot()` create a graph from 2 dimensions of data to find out relationship. We can generate different views by parameter "kind".

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-2">
    <img src="https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/note-data-science-eps/ep-03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-11-at-22.38.51.png" alt="kde" loading="lazy">

    <em>hex (hexagon) shows hexagonal figure of scatter chart with heat map colorization and histogram</em>
  </div>
  <div class="col-2">
  </div>
</div>

### Pair plot

`sns.pairplot()` displays all combinations of numeric columns of the data.

![pairplot](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/note-data-science-eps/ep-03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-11-at-22.47.29.png)

### Relational plot

`sns.relplot()` is the advance scatter plot allowing multiple breakdowns. Here are "hue" for different colors and "size" for different size.

![relplot](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/note-data-science-eps/ep-03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-11-at-23.07.57.png)

### Violin plot

`sns.violinplot()` shows density of each breakdown.

![violinplot](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/note-data-science-eps/ep-03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-11-at-23.11.38.png)

### Heat map

`sns.heatmap()` is a heat map to visualize numbers in scale.

This function requires numeric values only. Here is the example:

Let's say we want a heat map of number of survivors in each "Pclass" and "Sex". We have to `.groupby()` then `.sum()` over column "Survived".

![heatmap df group](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/note-data-science-eps/ep-03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-11-at-23.38.18.png)

We apply `.pivot()` to create a pivot table.

![heatmap df pivot](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/note-data-science-eps/ep-03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-11-at-23.38.28.png)

Finally, run `sns.heatmap()` with `annot=True` to display numbers.

![heatmap](https://bluebirzdotnet.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/note-data-science-eps/ep-03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-11-at-23.45.15.png)

---

From my side, `seaborn` is a great tool allowing us create pretty graphs with ease but sometimes we need `matplotlib` for more complex or customizable ones.

Hope this is useful for ya

See ya next time.

Bye~
