As a developer, I have to install many programs for my own works. However, I don't have to spend time on searching how to install, update, and remove those because I have one place to handle them all. Homebrew is my cup of brewed coffee now.

## What is homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager for MacOS and Linux. Most of necessary, popular, or essential packages (and programs) can be found here. This is the homepage of Homebrew.

<https://brew.sh/>

Homebrew is easy to use. Once we install Homebrew by running the command on the Homebrew homepage, it's ready now.

There are 2 types of package we can install with Homebrew:

1. **Formulae**. Formulae is a package that is built from source itself.
1. **Cask**. Cask is a native app.
