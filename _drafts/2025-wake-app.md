When we are running somethings e.g. building apps or testing, we would like to have the machine stays active. When it goes to sleep or shut down then we have to start over and that wastes a lot of time.

These apps can help us and I use it (almost) every day.

## Amphetamine for Mac

> Amphetamine is extremely powerful and includes advanced features for those who need them, yet remains intuitive and simple to use for those who don't need all the bells and whistles.

The app can be install via App store [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12). After install, we can change and update settings right here:

![amphetamine settings](../assets/img/tmp/awake/amph1-settings.png){: style="max-width:100%;margin:auto;"}

There are many ways to start new session. It can be a specific period, or until a specific time, or even indefinitely.

![amphetamine menu](../assets/img/tmp/awake/amph2-menu.png){: style="max-width:50%;margin:auto;" .apply-border}

Once the session is started, we can view the details like when the session will end or we can extend it here as well.

## Awake for Windows

Awake is a part of PowerToys that is a app collection for Windows for productivity. We can install PowerToys from [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/install).

After install, we can see "Awake" in the PowerToys settings. Enable it and we should find it in the system tray.

![awake in powertoys](../assets/img/tmp/awake/awake1-powertoys.png){: style="max-width:100%;margin:auto;" .apply-border}

"Awake" allows us to "keep awake" indefinitely or a certain period of time up to 2 hours.

![awake options](../assets/img/tmp/awake/awake2-options.png){: style="max-width:90%;margin:auto;" .apply-border}

And we can move the cursor over the icon in system tray to see how much time it will end.
