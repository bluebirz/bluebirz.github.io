There is a situation we need to create a resource with complex nested blocks then we can consider this block type to facilitate the flexibility of our code.

It's `dynamic` block.

---

## `dynamic` block

`dynamic` block is used to generate multiple nested blocks within a resource or module based on a collection of values. It allows you to create complex configurations dynamically, making your Terraform code more flexible and reusable.

However, using too many `dynamic` blocks can cause readability problems from ...

---

## Syntax

`dynamic` block must have `content` block inside.

```terraform
resource "<resource_type>" "<resource_name>" {
  ...
  dynamic "<block_type>" {
    for_each = <expression>
    content {
      attribute_1 = "<value>"
      attribute_2 = "<value>"
      ...
    }
  }
  ...
}
```
