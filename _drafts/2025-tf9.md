There is a situation we need to create a resource with complex nested blocks then we can consider this block type to facilitate the flexibility of our code.

It's `dynamic` block.

---

## `dynamic` block

`dynamic` block is used to generate multiple nested blocks within a resource or module based on a collection of values. It allows you to create complex configurations dynamically, making your Terraform code more flexible and reusable.

However, using too many `dynamic` blocks can cause readability problems from ...

---

## Syntax

`dynamic` block must have `content` block inside with `for_each`.

Read more about `for_each` in [part 8 - Conditions and Repetition]({% post_url 2025-08-24-try-terraform-part-8 %}).

```terraform
resource "<resource_type>" "<resource_name>" {
  ...
  dynamic "<block_type>" {
    for_each = <expression>
    content {
      attribute_1 = "<value>"
      attribute_2 = "<value>"
      ...
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

---

```terraform
variable "buckets" {
  type = map(object({
    name              = string
    delete_after_days = optional(number)
  }))
}


resource "google_storage_bucket" "bucket" {
  for_each = var.buckets
  name     = each.value.name
  location = "US"
  dynamic "lifecycle_rule" {
    for_each = each.value.delete_after_days != null ? [each.value.delete_after_days] : []
    content {
      action {
        type = "Delete"
      }
      condition {
        age = each.value.delete_after_days
      }
    }
  }

```

```terraform
buckets = {
  test1 = {
    name = "test-1"
  },
  test2 = {
    name              = "test-2"
    delete_after_days = 30
  },
}
```
