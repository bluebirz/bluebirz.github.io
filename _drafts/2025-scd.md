Data warehouses capture data, and data can change over time, slowly or rapidly.

Let's talk about the concept of capturing their changes.

---

## Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)

Slowly Changing Dimensions or SCD is one of core concepts in data warehousing. Because we receive new data every day, then the question is how could we improve our data warehouses to be effective in cost, performance, and quality.

---

## Types of SCD

SCDs are divided into 6 types, and each type has its own way of handling changes in data.

|Type|Action|Popularity|
|:-:|-|-|
|Type 0|No change|Low|
|Type 1|Overwrite|Medium|
|Type 2|Insert rows|High|
|Type 3|Separate historical columns|Medium|
|Type 4|Separate historical tables|Low|
|Type 5|Type 1 + Type 4|Low|
|Type 6|Type 1 + Type 2 + Type 3|Low|

### SCD type 0

Type 0 is a type of unchanging or constants e.g. postal codes.

![type0](../assets/img/tmp/scd-type0-dark.png){: .dark style="max-width:66%;margin:auto;"}
![type0](../assets/img/tmp/scd-type0-light.png){: .light style="max-width:66%;margin:auto;"}

### SCD type 1

Type 1 is an overwriting, no old data is kept. It's good in case we don't want to maintain the history or the data is not much important and we want just a current data.

![type1](../assets/img/tmp/scd-type1-dark.png){: .dark style="max-width:66%;margin:auto;"}
![type1](../assets/img/tmp/scd-type1-light.png){: .light style="max-width:66%;margin:auto;"}

### SCD type 2

Type 2 is a popular one as we need to track all history then we keep adding the updated rows into the tables but gain more table size in exchange.

![type2](../assets/img/tmp/scd-type2-dark.png){: .dark style="max-width:70%;margin:auto;"}
![type2](../assets/img/tmp/scd-type2-light.png){: .light style="max-width:70%;margin:auto;"}

### SCD type 3

Type 3 is to separate the historical data into dedicated columns. We can choose that we are going to track the original values (to see the first and the last in soe cases) or the previous values before change (to see the recent changes).

![type3](../assets/img/tmp/scd-type3-dark.png){: .dark style="max-width:75%;margin:auto;"}
![type3](../assets/img/tmp/scd-type3-light.png){: .light style="max-width:75%;margin:auto;"}

### SCD type 4

Type 4 means we maintain a separated table to track the history (partially like type 3 but tables) and update the main table to keep latest data (like type 1). It's useful when we need to trace back we can find in historical table, and find the main table in most cases to see the recent data.

![type4](../assets/img/tmp/scd-type4-dark.png){: .dark style="max-width:75%;margin:auto;"}
![type4](../assets/img/tmp/scd-type4-light.png){: .light style="max-width:75%;margin:auto;"}

### Type 5

### SCD type 6

Type 6 is a combination. This type has the latest data like type 1, and the historical rows like type 2, plus the historical columns like type 3. We can add some flag to indicate the latest rows.

It's benefit is we can track historical data in both columns and rows way depending on the use cases but requires more space and gain complexity.

![type6](../assets/img/tmp/scd-type6-dark.png){: .dark style="max-width:100%;margin:auto;"}
![type6e](../assets/img/tmp/scd-type6-light.png){: .light style="max-width:100%;margin:auto;"}
