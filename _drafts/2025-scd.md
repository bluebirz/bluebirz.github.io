Data warehouses capture data, and data can change over time, slowly or rapidly.

Let's talk about the concept of capturing their changes.

## Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)

Slowly Cahnging Dimensions or SCD is one of core concepts in data warehousing. Because we receive new data every day, then the question is how could we improve our data warehouses to be effective in cost, performance, and quality.

## Types of SCD

SCDs are divided into 6 types plus 1 type of no changing, and each type has its own way of handling changes in data.

|Type|Action|
|:-:|-|
|Type 0|No change|
|Type 1|Overwrite|
|Type 2|Insert rows|
|Type 3|Separate historical columns|
|Type 4|Separate historical tables|
|Type 5|Type 2 + Type 3|
|Type 6|Type 1 + Type 2 + Type 3|
