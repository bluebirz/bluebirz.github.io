Data warehouses capture data, and data can change over time, slowly or rapidly.

Let's talk about the concept of capturing their changes.

## Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)

Slowly Changing Dimensions or SCD is one of core concepts in data warehousing. Because we receive new data every day, then the question is how could we improve our data warehouses to be effective in cost, performance, and quality.

## Types of SCD

SCDs are divided into 6 types, and each type has its own way of handling changes in data.

|Type|Action|Popularity|
|:-:|-|-|
|Type 0|No change|Low|
|Type 1|Overwrite|Medium|
|Type 2|Insert rows|High|
|Type 3|Separate historical columns|Medium|
|Type 4|Separate historical tables|Low|
|Type 6|Type 1 + Type 2 + Type 3|Low|

### SCD type 0

Type 0 is a type of unchanging or constants e.g. postal codes e.g. "12345" is city A.

### SCD type 1

Type 1 is an overwriting. I usually call it "Full load" because I have to replace the updated data over the full table, no old data is kept.

This type is quite popular yet not often used because the final result is not the historical. This is good for low importance data and/or small dataset.

### SCD type 2

### SCD type 3

### SCD type 4

### SCD type 6
