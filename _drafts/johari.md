I have an opportunity to attend a seminar about the Johari window model. It is a model to reflect us about our relationship with others. The model is so simple yet powerful enough to improve the relationship and our own self. This model has the name "Johari" from the founder "Joseph Luft" and "Harry Ingham" who created it in 1955.

## What is "Johari window model"?

This "Johari window model" is partitioning one's expressions towards others' perceptions through a 2x2 matrix. The matrix looks like this figure.

*Johari window model*

1. **open** is the open part of our own.  
  For example, They know I'm kind as I always help them. A kindness is a part I control and let them see.
1. **blind** is a part the others can see but we don't notice it.  
  For example, They think I'm hot-tempered because I usually urge and shout at them for the works but I think everyone is just lazy and I just want to get the works done.
1. **hide** is a hidden part of ourselves.  
  For example, I am so exhausted at work because of my personal problems but I have to say it's all okay not to let them worry about me.
1. **unknown** is the part in our shadows that no one knows before.  
  For example, I never know I am a good presenter because there are very few activities in my company and one of my colleague all the time is the MC of those activities.

## How can one improve them?

Look at the

![johari solve](johari-solve.drawio.png){:style="max-width:75%;margin:auto;"}

1. **open**  is good now.
1. **blind**  area can be reduced by **feedback**  
1. **hide** area can be reduced by **disclose**
1. **unknown** area can be reduced by:  
    - **discover together**
    - **notice by others**
    - **self-explore**
