In teamwork, one can be good at a part yet not good at another. There are always rooms for improvement for everyone in the team.

**Feedback** is a great tool for every kind of work that we can make it the input for a person to improve, thrive, and grow. But how can we create **good feedback** without hurting our team members or our interlocutors?

Here is the note of training I participated to learn about **Constructive feedback**.

---

## Concept of "feedback"

In general, feedback is a kind of reaction to an action of a person. While a feedback in communication meanings is **a concious and powerful response towards words, phrases, behaviors, and actions** of the person.

---

## Criticism ≠ Feedback

- **Criticism** intends to **judge** a person, tell how bad they are and usually related to **the past of a person** that one can't do anything about it
- **Feedback** provides a **corrective, balanced information**, helping a person to change their behavior in the future, as well as **encouraging** them and related to both **the past and the future**. A person can change their behavior in the future with the feedback received.

---

## Goals of constructive feedback

- Deliver how a behavior is perceived.
- Encourage to consciously compare between intentions and effects.
- Suggest an acceptable alternative behavior.
- Motivate to change behavior.
- Increase self-esteem and confidence.

---

## Basic rules of constructive feedback

- How to **provide** feedback
  - Ask the person first if they want to receive feedback.
  - Use I-message (e.g. "I feel that…")
  - Praise more than criticize.
  - Clear and sincere.
- How to **receive** feedback
  - Don't reply immediately.
  - Thank for the feedback.
  - KSS (Keep-Stop-StaRt) framework:
    - What to keep doing
    - What to stop doing
    - What to start doing

---

## Model of providing constructive feedback

1. Sandwich rule (+/-/+)
    - Start with what was good.
    - Proceed with the specific behavior to be changed.
    - End with another positive aspect.

2. Russian sandwich rule (+++/-)
    - Start with what was good, as much positive and many as you can.
    - End with the specific behavior to be changed.

And after providing constructive feedback, **following up is important** to see if the person has changed their behavior or not.
