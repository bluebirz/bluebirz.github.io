In teamwork, we can't be individually perfect. One can be good at this yet not good at that. There are always rooms for improvement.

**Feedback** is a great tool for every kind of work that we can make it the input for a person to thrive and grow. But how can we create **good feedback** without hurting our team member or interlocutor?

Here is the note of training I participated to learn about **Constructive feedback**.

## Concept of "feedback"

In general, feedback is a kind of reaction to an action of a person. While a feedback in communication meanings is **a concious and powerful response towards words, phrases, behaviors, and actions** of the person.

## Goals of constructive feedback

- Deliver how a behavior is perceived
- Encourage to consciously compare intentions and effects
- Suggest an acceptable alternative behavior
- Motivate to change behavior
- Increase self-esteem and confidence

## Criticism ≠ Feedback

- Intention:
  - Criticism is distinguished by the intention to judge a person, tell how bad they are
  - Feedback provides a corrective, balanced information, helping a person to change their behavior, as well as encouraging them
- Time aspects:
  - Criticism usually related only to the past:a person cannot do anything about it
  - Feedback is related to both the past and the future: with the feedback received a person can change their behavior in the future

- ## Basic rules of giving and receiving feedback
 	- How to provide feedback
  		- First ask the person
  		- Use I-message (I feel that…)
  		- Praise more than criticize (2+ pos 1 neg)
  		- Clear and sincere
 	- How to receive feedback
  		- Don't reply immediately
  		- Thank for the feedback
  		- KSS (keep-stop-start)

- ## Model of providing feedback
 	- 1. Sandwich rule (+|-|+)
  		- Start with what was good
  		- Proceed to the specific behavior that is to be chanted
  		- Finalize with another positive aspect
 	- 2. Russian sandwich rule (+++|-)
  		- Start with what was good, as much positive as you can
  		- Finalize with what about to be changed

- ## Knowledge implementation and exercise for training
 	- Think again of a feedback in general
 	- Feedback models
 	- KSS
 	- Track behavior changes
