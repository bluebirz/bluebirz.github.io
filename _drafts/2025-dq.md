**Freshness**

Freshness measures when the data was last updated. Having this information can help you determine whether the data is recent enough to be useful.

**Volume**

Volume measures whether all of the expected data is present.

**Completeness**

Completeness assesses whether the data contains all of the information that's required for its intended purpose.

**Validity**

Validity evaluates whether the data conforms to predefined standards for format, acceptable ranges, or other criteria. For example, if a valid date needs to have the formatÂ `YYYY/mm/dd`, then 08-12-2019 is invalid data. As another example, if a valid sales price for an item is between $10 and $20, then a sales price of $100 is invalid data.

**Consistency**

Consistency refers to having the same values for data across multiple instances, such as tables and columns. Inconsistency in data arises when, for example, the revenue of a product differs when it is read from a sales database or a usage database.

**Accuracy**

Accuracy reflects the correctness of the data. Note that data that is valid isn't necessarily accurate. For example, a valid hair color might be brown, but if a person doesn't have brown hair, that is inaccurate data.

**Uniqueness**

Uniqueness measures whether the data is distinct with no duplicates.
